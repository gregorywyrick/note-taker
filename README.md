# Note Taker Web Application

## Description

I am very pleased to bring you this note taking web application. Using notebooks is old school, in today's day and age everyone is taking notes digitally. To ensure we are all up with the times, and well organized, I have created this application deployed on Heroku. Rather than trying to keep up with loose random pieces of paper, you are able to add new notes, and go back to view/change them whenever you like.

## Installation

In order to install this application, the user must first clone this repository on their local device. Once cloned, the user must go into the folder and install the necessary dependencies using "npm i" from the command line.

## Usage

To use this application the user must first navigate to the deployed Heroku page (found here: https://gw-notes-taker.herokuapp.com/). Once there, simply click the "Get Started" button that appears on screen. From there the user can add a title for their new note, as well as whatever contents they choose in the body. To keep track of this note, the user will click the save icon in the top right corner of the page. The note will then appear on the left side of the screen in a list format.

## Credit

For the application, the back end work was done by myself (GitHub user gregorywyrick). The front end work was done by Github user Xandromus, so all credit belongs to them for the front end work. 

## License

No license was used in the making of this application.
